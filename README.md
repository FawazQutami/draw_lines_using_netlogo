# NetLogo Application

## Draw lines using NetLogo

The model is a space where one can create two points then link them together, as well as 
move these points from one location to another within the space, besides other things.

The model switching between four modes (Create, Delete, Move, and Draw). 
To start using the model, first, you need to click on the “Setup” button to prepare 
the workspace.

	1. Click on “Create”, to switch to create mode, then click anywhere in the space to 
		create the link start point, leave some space, then click once again to create 
		the link endpoint; the model will automatically create a line between these two points.
	2. Click on “Delete”, to switch to delete mode, then click over a point - either 
		start point or endpoint, to automatically delete the link.
	3. Click on “Move”, to switch to move mode, then click and hold the mouse button 
		over a point - either start point or endpoint, move the point somewhere else, 
		then release the mouse.
	4. Click on “Draw Angled Shape”, to switch to Draw a free angled shape, choose 
		an angle from the “Angle” slider and the steps from the “Steps” slider, then 
		click the button to automatically draw the shape. (only the last link will be 
		considered)
	5. “Lines Counter” is for tracing how many lines exists in the world space.
	6. “Flag” and “Last Flag”: to trace the switching between the 4 modes 
		(Create, Delete, and Move).
